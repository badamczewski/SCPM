# SCPM - Smart Computation (Concurrent) Programming Model

This is a library that aims to bring a concurrent work distribution model by using the notion of computations as primary resource.

Additionally it will expose most of internal structures, algorithms and sync primitives as well as add new ones that will ease concurrent, parrarel and distributed developement (sometimes computation/actor based models are not the way to go but many structures can be used).
